> According to a Careerbuilder survey, a bad hire can cost the hiring organization as much as $50K

how much does a false negative cost?

> The problem arises in measurement. It is easy to know False Positives but impossible to know False Negatives (i.e. we know if we made a bad hire but we know nothing about those we passed on)

>  We learn nothing from False Negatives. And there is a huge risk we miss out on a 20x employee.
