# Not Software Craftsmanship

> We politely inquired of these white-smocked workers exactly what they were doing. "We're craftsmen, proof of our company's dedication to quality," they replied. (1)

We care about quality, but there are many ways to approach quality. An individual craftsperson can toil on an object of high quality; a team of craftspeople can specialize and colloborate, using apprenticenship to guide newcomers into their craft, and agile methods to work together; or we can move the crafting relation to a higher level and examine the means of production, the relation between working capacity and supply, the ability to define and measure properties of our process, like defect rates, and use them as guidance for improvement. This is scientification of craft.

agile gets some parts of this relationship right but focuses on client and provider
we need provider to provider relationships as well, we are all clients for the software we use to build our software
by developing a consumer provider network, where we are flexible in our roles, sometimes consumer sometimes provider, we can reduce rework/defect rates, and actually work together to build things

> adjusting off-standard parts, fine-tuning parts designed so as to need adjustment, and rectifying incorrect previous assembly work so that everything would work properly in the end. (3)

it’s not necessarily increasing the level, but finding the right abstraction, because our contracts between each other aren’t working
I take your react module and have to custom fit it, I’ve already lost, we’ve lost together

## Tools towards a better

## Beautiful Code

> Beautiful code is short and concise, so if you were to give
that code to another programmer the would say, "oh, that's
well written code." It's much like as if you were writting a
poem. (4)

There's a whole poorly thought out cottage industry that has sprung up around "Beautiful Code". Sorry, code is not poetry and the movement is a lie. Code is a science not an art. There is no beauty in code except that which exhibits correctness.
